# Studentships
Proposals for bio.agents studentships.

[IECHOR Denmark](<http://iechor-node.cbs.dtu.dk/>) - the coordinating node of the [bio.agents](https://dev.bio.agents) project - has earmarked funds to support studentships to work on curation-focussed mini-projects for bio.agents.  Projects must have clear and quantifiable impact on bio.agents content, in terms of number of entries and / or content quality.  Projects can include developments of some agenting, so long as this contributes directly to the project goals.

For further information, see the [studentship scheme description](http://bioagents.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studentships.html).
